# Installing Python
Python is a programming language that is powerful but easy to learn. It is free, platform-independent, and popular among scientists.

## Recommended Method: Anaconda
The Anaconda Python distribution is an easily-installable bundle of Python and many of the libraries used throughout this class. Unless you have a good reason not to, we recommend that you use Anaconda.

### Mac/Linux users
1. Download the [appropriate version](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) of Anaconda
1. Follow the instructions on that page to run the installer
1. Test it out: open a terminal window, and type ``python``, you should see something like
```
Python 3.8.3 (default, Jul  2 2020, 17:30:36) [MSC v.1916 64 bit (AMD64)] :: Anaconda, Inc. on win32
```
If `Anaconda` doesn't appear on the first line, you are using a different version of Python. See the troubleshooting section below.

1. Test out the IPython notebook: open a Terminal window, and type `ipython notebook`. A new browser window should pop up. 
1. Click `New Notebook` to create a new notebook file
1. Update IPython to the newest version by typing `conda update ipython` at the command line

### Windows Users
1. Download the [appropriate version](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) of Anaconda
1. Follow the instructions on that page to run the installer. This will create a directory at `C:\Anaconda`
1. Test it out: start the Anaconda launcher, which you can find in `C:\Anaconda` or, in the Start menu. Start the IPython notebook. A new browser window should open. 
1. Click `New Notebook`, which should open a new page.
